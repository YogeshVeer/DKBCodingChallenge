Things which i have done - Good Question :)

Honestly it is pretty straight forward - I hope i made it straight forward in given time by following SOLID in most cases

1. Clean architecture 
2. Did not use details API - I do not see the requirement for it
3. SingleValueContainer


Things i would do if i have more time 

1. I have noticed Albums are grouped via ID i am not sure that i should do that as well in UI since other albumId there are no related info. If it needs to be grouped or paginated it would be great but API does not support.
2. Dependency containers/ factory to make more testabe 
3. Unit test
4. Combine for URL session 
5. Error handling 
lot many :)
